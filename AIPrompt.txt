Here is the context for the rest of our chat:

I'm working on a project called RiskiPedia.
It is implemented in PHP and JavaScript on top of the WikiMedia code base
and the DataTable2 extension.
The public web server is a Google Cloud Debian Linux server based on
the Bitnami package for MediaWiki 1.43.0
Documentation:   https://docs.bitnami.com/google/apps/mediawiki/
The main URL for the riskipedia wiki is https://riski.wiki/

The idea of RiskiPedia is to create an open, interactive "encyclopedia
of risks". For example, a visitor might be interested in their risk of
getting a sexually transmitted infection after sex with a new partner
and would visit the RiskiPedia "Sick after Sex" page to
explore the risks. There they will find some text describing what the
major factors are that affect the chances of getting an STI, and
then interactive elements that let them customize the scenario for
their circumstances-- for example, if any birth control was used,
what type of sex acts were performed, their partner's STI status
(if known), etc. The page will dynamically update to show
human-friendly risk numbers for relevant outcomes; e.g.
"You have a 1 in 10 chance of getting Herpes" or
"You have a 1 in 3 chance of getting any sexually transmitted infection."

RiskiPedia is a wiki -- anybody will be able to create pages and
upload data on any risk that interests them. Our challenge is to
create easy-to-use WikiMedia extensions so moderately technically
proficient people can create pages (like Wikipedia, where page
creators have to have some knowledge of wikitext markup and how to use the
Wikimedia software).

Data is stored in <datatable2> tables.

The following RiskiPedia-specific custom tags have been implemented:

DataTable2 Doc:  https://riski.wiki/wiki/Help:DataTable2?action=raw
RiskModel Doc:  https://riski.wiki/wiki/Help:RiskModel?action=raw
DropDown Doc: https://riski.wiki/wiki/Help:DropDown?action=raw
RiskDisplay Doc:  https://riski.wiki/wiki/Help:RiskDisplay?action=raw
RiskParameter Doc:  https://riski.wiki/wiki/Help:RiskParameter?action=raw

And the following Templates/Modules:

One_In_X
ProbabilityFormat Source: https://riski.wiki/wiki/Module:ProbabilityFormat

RiskModel and datatable2 data are put on /Data pages, and define how to calculate risks.
DropDown, RiskDisplay and RiskParameter are used on the main risk pages.
