UserInfo.css should be moved out of gadgets

UserInfo.js
    Should call FindData whenever a field is updated, and use all fields to search, when possible.
    maybe make the countries list update depending on what is available on the current page

Dt2 function
    I think user should input the country and the gender of the table being loaded and maybe these tables should be stored on one page
