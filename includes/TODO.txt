Implement a <RiskDisplay> that references a <RiskModel> and Does Stuff.

Example... page with several <DropDown> for pregnancy risk
then:

<RiskDisplay model="...">
Your risk of getting pregnant after one session of penis-in-vagina intercourse is about <n> in 100.
</RiskDisplay>

RiskDisplay doesn't display anything until all of the model params have been set. It replaces <n> with the calculated risk, dynamically.

??? What about comparing risks ???
Maybe a <RiskCompare model="..."></RiskCompare> that Does Something Magical?
