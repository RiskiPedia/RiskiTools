I broke DropDown's ability to have persistent state.
I like the way it handles per-page state.

Brainstorming bringing back persistent state:

Add "persist" attribute to DropDown and any other UI elements, which could be a list of keys to persist (e.g. persist=Age or persist="Age,Country")

Or is 'make this state persistent' orthogonal to the UI elements?
Maybe some other thing on the page that has an event listener mw.hook that Does The Right Thing.
(and sets page state on startup so UI elements start in the right state).

e.g. <Persist data="Age,Country"></Persist> next to the <DropDown> (or anywhere on the page) Does Stuff.

It'd be super nice RiskDisplay could summarize the inputs, like:

31-year-old woman
20-year-old partner           About a 5% (one in twenty) chance of getting pregnant per month
using no contraception     
intercourse 11 times/month

If we go with templates to generalize {result}, could all the pagedata keys/values be passed along?
