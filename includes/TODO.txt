Implement a <RiskDisplay> that references a <RiskModel> and Does Stuff.

Example... page with several <DropDown> for pregnancy risk
then:

<RiskDisplay model="...">
</RiskDisplay>

RiskDisplay doesn't display anything until all of the model params have been set. It replaces <n> with the calculated risk, dynamically.

??? What about comparing risks ???
Maybe a <RiskCompare model="..."></RiskCompare> that Does Something Magical?

OR: Probably better if the "Your risk of..." is part of the RiskModel.

e.g.

<RiskModel name="pregnancy_risk_per_month" calculation="...">
{result} in 100 chance of getting pregnant per month.
</RiskModel>

It'd be super nice if it could summarize the inputs, like:

31-year-old woman
20-year-old partner           About a 5% (one in twenty) chance of getting pregnant per month
using no contraception     
intercourse 11 times/month
