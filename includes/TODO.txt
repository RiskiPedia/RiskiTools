clean up userInfoInput, split fields into separate modules, put them in a folder together maybe

set up github RiskiTools fork on the server

add time span, data type, and column inputss for fetchData to the dt2 header

modify dt2-table2JS to load all tables on one page, possible could use API but probably dont need to
