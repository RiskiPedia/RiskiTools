Here is the context for the rest of our chat:

I'm working on a project called RiskiPedia.
It is implemented in PHP and JavaScript on top of the WikiMedia code base
and the DataTable2 extension.
The public web server is a Google Cloud Debian Linux server based on
the Bitnami package for MediaWiki 1.43.0
Documentation:   https://docs.bitnami.com/google/apps/mediawiki/
The main URL for the riskipedia wiki is https://riski.wiki/

The idea of RiskiPedia is to create an open, interactive "encyclopedia
of risks". For example, a visitor might be interested in their risk of
getting pregnant and would visit the RiskiPedia Pregnancy page to
explore the risks. There they will find some text describing what the
major factors are that affect the chances of getting pregnant, and
then interactive elements that let them customize the scenario for
their circumstances-- for example, their age, the age of their
partner, and what type of birth control they're using (if any). The
page will dynamically update to display the chances of getting
pregnant in terms that (hopefully) are easy to understand.

RiskiPedia will be a wiki -- anybody will be able to create pages and
upload data on any risk that interests them. Our challenge is to
create easy-to-use WikiMedia extensions so moderately technically
proficient people can create pages (like Wikipedia, where page
creators have to have some knowledge of wiki markup and how to use the
Wikimedia software). Every front-facing interactive page will have a
page full of data and references and "risk models" that have the
calculations that take the user-provided input and calculates risk
numbers (e.g. "a 11 in 100 chance of getting pregnant per month").

Data will be stored in <datatable2> tables.

I have already implemented a <DropDown> UI extension that shows data
from a <datatable2> table and lets the user select one of the choices.
The choice is stored in a session variable that is sent to the server
and stored as part of their session (so choices are remembered and
data like the user's age are remembered across different pages of the
site).
